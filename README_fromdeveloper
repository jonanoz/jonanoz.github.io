Prior to running the game two things must be managed by the user:

1: You must download the csv file "CharactersCSV.csv" to a reachable file location on your local machine.

2: You must add the UNC path of the "CharactersCSV.csv" file location into variable "csvpath" in the below files:
    -Play.cs
    -Characters.cs
Please let me know if you run into any issues. 
Thank you!
