##Welcome to the Tic Tac Tactical Game!

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jonanoz/jonanoz.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

I wanted to strengthen my knowledge using C#/.NET framework by creating a simple textbased RPG/TicTacToe inspired game. 
The game is called Tic Tac Tactical where you are asked to select three characters from a list to defeat your enemy (the computer). 
The character list can be found in the main menu by selecting option 2, or by opening and reviwing the CharactersCSV.csv file on the main page above. 
Your team will fight against the enemy team automatically in the background and return if you won or not.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jonanoz/jonanoz.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
