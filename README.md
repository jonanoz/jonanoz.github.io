## Welcome to the Tic Tac Tactical Game!

Hello Everyone,

My name is Jon and I wanted to strengthen my knowledge using C#/.NET framework by creating a simple textbased RPG/TicTacToe inspired game. 
The game is called Tic Tac Tactical where you are asked to select three characters from a list to defeat your enemy (the computer). 
The character list can be found in the main menu by selecting option 2, or by opening and reviwing the CharactersCSV.csv file on the main page above. 
Your team will fight against the enemy team automatically in the background and return if you won or not. 

### Before you begin!!
```markdown
Prior to running the game two things must be managed by the user:

1: 
You must download the csv file "CharactersCSV.csv" to a reachable 
file location on your local machine.

2: 
You must add the UNC path of the "CharactersCSV.csv" file location 
into variable "csvpath" in the below files:

    -Play.cs
    -Characters.cs
    
Please let me know if you run into any issues. 
Thank you!

```
